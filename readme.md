#Dropbox Application
This is a basic dropbox application that runs on Electron. Currently this does not connect to a server; it is being tested to perfection locally before building an API to interface with a server.

#How It Works
You input a local directory (eg. `/Users/me/Desktop/dropbox`) and a server directory (eg. `/Users/me/Desktop/copy`). Now, every time you put files into the local directory, they should automatically copy over to the server directory.
